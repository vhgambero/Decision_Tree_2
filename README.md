# Decision Tree Models Repository
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of Decision Tree models, a fundamental technique in machine learning for classification and regression tasks. It aims to provide a comprehensive collection of code examples, experiments, and analyses related to decision trees.

## Purpose
The primary objectives of this repository are to:

## Model Implementation:
Document various implementations of decision tree algorithms on different datasets.
### Parameter Tuning:
Explore and analyze the impact of hyperparameters, such as tree depth and splitting criteria, on model performance.
### Visualizations: Include visual representations of decision trees to enhance understanding of the model structure and decision-making process.
## Methodology
### Data Preparation:
Preprocess datasets, including cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
### Model Training:
Implement decision tree models using libraries such as Scikit-learn.
### Model Evaluation:
Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Visualization:
Create visual representations of decision trees for better interpretability.
## Technologies Used
*Python:* Primary programming language for implementing decision tree models.
Scikit-learn: Library used for building and evaluating decision trees.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
## Future Developments
As I continue to explore decision tree models, I plan to add more complex variations, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees, and apply these techniques to various real-world datasets.
